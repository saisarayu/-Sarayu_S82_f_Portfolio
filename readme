Rendering Strategies in Next.js (Static, Dynamic & Hybrid)
Overview

This project demonstrates how different data rendering strategies in Next.js App Router affect performance, scalability, and data freshness. Instead of using a single rendering approach across the application, pages are rendered based on the nature of their data and user requirements.

The application intentionally uses Static Rendering (SSG), Dynamic Rendering (SSR), and Hybrid Rendering (ISR) to achieve a balanced and scalable architecture.

Rendering Trade-offs

Rendering decisions are made using the trade-off triangle:

Speed

Freshness

Scalability

Each rendering mode optimizes two of these while sacrificing one.

Rendering Type	Performance	Data Freshness	Scalability
Static (SSG)	High	Low	High
Dynamic (SSR)	Medium	High	Medium
Hybrid (ISR)	Medium	Medium	Medium
Rendering Strategies Used in the Application
Static Rendering (SSG)

Used for

Public landing pages

Informational and featured content

Reason
These pages change infrequently and are accessed by many users. Static rendering ensures fast load times, low latency, and excellent scalability.

Implementation

fetch(url, { cache: 'force-cache' })


Impact

Fastest page load

Zero server computation per request

Data may become stale over time

Dynamic Rendering (SSR)

Used for

User dashboard

Personalized or authenticated pages

Reason
User-specific data must always be accurate and up to date. Caching or static generation could result in incorrect data being shown to users.

Implementation

fetch(url, { cache: 'no-store' })


or

export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';


Impact

Always fresh data

Higher server cost

Slower than static pages

Hybrid Rendering (ISR)

Used for

News feed

Frequently updated public content

Reason
This data changes often but does not require real-time updates on every request. ISR provides a balance between freshness and performance while keeping infrastructure costs under control.

Implementation

fetch(url, { next: { revalidate: 60 } })


Impact

Periodically fresh data

Better scalability than full SSR

Slight staleness between revalidation windows

Case Study: “The News Portal That Felt Outdated”
Problem

The homepage was initially statically generated, resulting in fast load times but outdated “Breaking News” content. Switching the entire site to server-side rendering fixed the freshness issue but caused slower page loads and increased hosting costs.

Analysis

Static rendering failed to keep time-sensitive content fresh

Dynamic rendering everywhere increased server load and cost

A single rendering strategy was applied where a mixed approach was needed

Balanced Solution Using Hybrid Rendering

A hybrid approach was implemented by splitting the homepage into sections:

Section	Rendering Strategy	Justification
Layout & Header	Static	Rarely changes
Featured Articles	ISR (5–10 minutes)	Not time-critical
Breaking News	ISR (30–60 seconds)	Requires frequent updates
User-specific Content	Dynamic	Personalized data
Example
fetch('/api/breaking-news', {
  next: { revalidate: 60 }
});


This approach maintains fast load times while ensuring critical content stays reasonably fresh without excessive server usage.

Rendering Decision Framework

The following logic is used to choose rendering strategies:

User-specific or real-time data → Dynamic Rendering

Public content that rarely changes → Static Rendering

Public content that updates frequently → Hybrid Rendering (ISR)

Video Demonstration

In the video demo, the following are demonstrated:

A statically rendered page and its performance benefits

A dynamically rendered dashboard requiring fresh data

A hybrid page using ISR to balance freshness and scalability

Explanation of why using SSR everywhere is not cost-effective

Conclusion

Using a combination of static, dynamic, and hybrid rendering allows the application to remain fast, scalable, and reasonably fresh. Rendering strategy is treated as a design decision rather than a default choice, ensuring that each page uses the most appropriate approach based on its data requirements.
